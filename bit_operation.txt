(a + b) = (a XOR b) + 2(a&b)

(a XOR b) = (a + b)%2 bitwise!

(a XOR b) = 2(a OR b) - (a + b)

You can find the XOR of the an array numbers from (l, r) by taking bitwise summation of the elements! And if sum is even then
there will be '0' bit otherwise '1'. And now you can apply matrix multiplication for the summation too :) [Refer problem HXR
